New Contributor Guide
=====================

First things first: Welcome to Mozilla! We're glad to have you here, whether
you're considering volunteering as a contributor or are employed by Mozilla.

Our goal here is to get you up and running to contribute as a test engineer. This guide attempts to be generic enough to be
useful to most Firefox Test Engineering projects, but some details (especially around
software you need installed) might vary among projects.

Baseline requirements include:
- Some coding experience, Python and Selenium WebDriver are used most often
- A basic understanding of GitHub
- a willingness to learn!

Let's get started!
