New Contributor Guide
=====================

First things first: Welcome to Mozilla! We're glad to have you here, whether

automation developer. This guide attempts to be generic enough to be
useful to most Firefox Test Engineering projects, but some details (especially around
software you need installed) may vary among projects.

Let's get started!
